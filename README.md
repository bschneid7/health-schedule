# Bryan’s Master Daily Health Schedule

This repo hosts a mobile‑friendly, interactive schedule (index.html) that lets you:
- Filter and search your regimen
- Save personal notes (local to your device)
- Print (or Save as PDF)
- Export CSV and iCal files on the fly

## How to publish with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new **public** repo (e.g., `health-schedule`).
2. Upload these three files to the **repo root**:
   - `.nojekyll`  (text file; contents: `disable jekyll`)
   - `index.html`
   - `README.md`
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` — **Folder:** `/ (root)` → **Save`
4. Your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.

> Tip: Use your browser’s **Print → Save as PDF** to produce a permanent PDF anytime. “Export CSV” and “Export iCal” buttons generate files locally in your browser (no server required).
